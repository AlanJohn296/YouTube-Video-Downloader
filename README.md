# YouTube-Video-Downloader
I made a YouTube video downloader using Python.
I took reference from YouTuber developedbyed and all credits goes to him.

Run this code in any IDE and the window to download will open. Paste the URL and hit download.

Before running the program make sure you got all the modules installed. The Modules used are Tkinter, customtkinter and pytube.

If the modules are not installed use these commands in terminal,

-> pip install tk

-> sudo apt-get install python3-tk (for linux based on Ubuntu)

-> pip install customtkinter

-> pip install pytube

# YouTube-Video-Downloader
This is a YouTube video downloader made using Python. To download the video in it's highest quality just use the share link.

To make this, I took reference from YouTuber developedbyed.

Run this code in any IDE and the window to download the video will open. Paste the share link and hit download.

Before running the program make sure you got all the Python modules installed. The Modules to download are Tkinter, customtkinter and pytube.
Note: The program will not run if the above modules are not installed.

To install tkinter module, type this command in your terminal.
-> **pip install tk**

**NOTE**: Tkinter module will not work as intended on few Linux distros. Use these commands if you encounter any problems related to tkinter module.

-> **sudo apt-get install python3-tk (for Linux distros based on Ubuntu)**

-> **sudo pacman -S tk (for Linux distros based on Arch)**

Also install customkinter & pytube. Type these following commands in your terminal.

-> **pip install customtkinter**

-> **pip install pytube**

After all modules are installed go ahead and run the program to download youtube videos.

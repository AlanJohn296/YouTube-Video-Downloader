# YouTube-Video-Downloader
I made a YouTube video downloader using Python which downloads the video in highest quality using the share link.

I took reference from YouTuber developedbyed to make this.

Run this code in any IDE and the window to download will open. Paste the share link and hit download.

Before running the program make sure you got all the modules installed. The Modules used are Tkinter, customtkinter and pytube.
The program will not work if the modules used are not installed.

To install tkinter module, type this command in your terminal.
-> **pip install tk**

**NOTE**: Tkinter module will not work as intended on few Linux distros. Use these commands if you encounter any problems related to tkinter module.

-> **sudo apt-get install python3-tk (for Linux distros based on Ubuntu)**

-> **sudo pacman -S tk (for Linux distros based on Arch)**

Also install customkinter & pytube. Type these following commands in your terminal.

-> **pip install customtkinter**

-> **pip install pytube**
